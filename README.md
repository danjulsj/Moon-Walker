# Moon-Walker
## Summary and Overview
### Where'd this come from?
During my experiences in NASA's HAS program and the following Moonshot Experience hosted by the Johnson Space Center down in Houston, I learned much about the difficulties in landing a craft on the Moon, with concerns about fine particles interfering with normal operations a chief concern. Currently, our source of transportation on the Moon's surface is a car. Two issues: the moon buggy throws up a decent amount of dust while moving which is not preferable. Secondly, the moon buggy is not efficient as a mode of transportation given the irregularities of the Moon's surface. This impedes the effectiveness of astronauts by preventing them from crossing certain landforms (such as getting out of a crater or climbing a rocky hill). 

### My solution
What animal do we commonly find in the smallest crevices of our homes, somehow climbing straight up walls? Not cats, spiders. These little menaces to society (not including those Australian Huntsman monstrosities) somehow manaage to access anywhere and everywhere at any time. How? their eight legs proide them ample maneuverability to get into that one closet right smack in the middle of your house. We can harness this ability to help us navigate rocky surfaces such as that of the Moon and Mars. A Walker, if you will.

### Why?
In spacesuits, astronauts can't move particularly well in a massive, clunky thing. Using an exoskeleton would be pointless if the dude can't really do anything. Rather, this solution is an external mobility device that moves us as compared to exoskeletons that respond to us moving. 
It is important to note that the Moon Walker is an autonomous device - the user inputs a specific location on a predefined map produced by radar scans of the surface, and the Moon Walker will decide the optimal path to the destination. This isn't anything new - I did a project in APCSA as a HS sophomomre that's similar to this, Mountain Climber, in which we code an algorithm to determine a path through a predefined set of data that maps the altitude of different points on the map by adding the adjacent point with the smallest altitude difference to a List that holds the points in the path.
